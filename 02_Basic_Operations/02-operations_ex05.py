# Basic Operations chapter, exercise 5:
# Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index 
# greater than or equal to the list's length? For example:

foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])      # will this result in an error?


# My answer: Yes, because indices start at 0. foo[3] does not exist.
# foo[2] is the last element in the list.
