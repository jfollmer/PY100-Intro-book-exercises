# Basic Operations chapter, exercise 1:
# Concatenate two strings, one with your first name and one with your last, 
# to create a new string with your full name as its value. For example, if your
# name is John Doe, you should combine 'John' and 'Doe' to get 'John Doe'.

first_name = "Jules"
last_name = "Follmer"

print(first_name + ' ' + last_name)
