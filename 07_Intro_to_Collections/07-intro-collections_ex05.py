# Introduction to Collections chapter, exercise 5:

# How do the set types differ from the sequence types?


# My answer:
#
# Sets aren't ordered or iterable.
# Sets can only contain one instance of each value ("values must be unique"
# language in given solution).
# Sets use the set() constructor.


# Given solution also mentions that sets don't support index access, which
# seems like a natural conclusion of not being ordered, but it's probably
# worth mentioning explicitly.
