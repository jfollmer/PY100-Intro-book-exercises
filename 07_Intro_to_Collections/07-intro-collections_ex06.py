# Introduction to Collections chapter, exercise 6:

# Assuming you have the following assignment:

pi = 3.141592

# Write some code that converts the value of pi to a string and assigns it to 
# a variable named str_pi.


# My solution:

str_pi = str(pi)


# An additional given solution, although first solution (matches mine) is
# preferred since it's more readable:

str_pi = f'{pi}'
