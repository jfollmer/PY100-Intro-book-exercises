# Introduction to Collections chapter, exercise 10:

# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. 
# Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)


# This will not print the names in alphabetical order because the value
# assigned to name is a set, and sets are unordered collections which print
# in random order.

# The given solution also mentions that it is possible, but rare.
