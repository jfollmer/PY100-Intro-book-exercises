# Introduction to Collections chapter, exercise 3:

# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at least 
# 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.


# My answer:

# Differences:
# Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.
# Lists use the [] literal, tuples use the () literal.
# Lists use the list() constructor, tuples use the tuple() constructor.

# Similarities:
# Both are iterable.
# Both are ordered collections.


# Additional similarities in the given solution:

# Lists and tuples are both sequences. Sequences are ordered collections that 
#   can use numeric indexes to access the members.
# Lists and tuples are heterogeneous; elements do not need to all be the same 
#   type. (Reminds me that you can nest both immutable and mutable objects 
#   inside a tuple even though tuples are immutable, and you can also nest 
#   these inside of lists.)
