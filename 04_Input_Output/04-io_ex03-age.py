# Input/Output chapter, exercise 3:
# Write a program named age.py that asks the user to enter their age, then 
# calculates and reports the future age 10, 20, 30, and 40 years from now. 
# Here's the output for someone who is 27 years old.

# How old are you? 27
#
# You are 27 years old.
# In 10 years, you will be 37 years old.
# In 20 years, you will be 47 years old.
# In 30 years, you will be 57 years old.
# In 40 years, you will be 67 years old.
